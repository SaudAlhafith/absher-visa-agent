**Goal:** Introduce the service inside Absher and let the user start a new visa preparation flow.

**What the user sees:**

* **Page Title:**
  “Visa Preparation Assistant”

* **Short description text:**
  Explains that Absher will prepare all visa requirements and embassy documents using existing government data, and help with booking an appointment.
